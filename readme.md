## AnyRec

AnyRec aims to be the starting point of any generic recommendation system (RS), 
reduce implementation overhead, and speed up development. 
It provides common components that are required in most RSs such as 
user management, data gathering and dispatching, API interfaces, 
and evaluation from an end userâ€™s perspective. 
The framework makes it convenient to implement new or improve existing user clients, 
recommendation algorithms, and data sources.
